Q: SwiftUI app life cycle iOS14 where to put AppDelegate code? (by M1X)

A: Here is a solution for SwiftUI life-cycle. Tested with Xcode 12b / iOS 14

```
import SwiftUI
import UIKit

// no changes in your AppDelegate class
class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        print(">> your code here !!")
        return true
    }
}

@main
struct Testing_SwiftUI2App: App {

    // inject into SwiftUI life-cycle via adaptor !!!
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```
