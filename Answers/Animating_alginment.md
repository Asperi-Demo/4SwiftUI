Q: How to make a simple up and down floating animation in SwitfUI? (by Susca Bogdan)

A: Updated: Xcode 13.4 / iOS 15.5

Here is possible simple approach. Tested with Xcode 11.4 / iOS 13.4. Of course parameters can be tuned by needs.

    struct BoncingView: View {
        @State private var bouncing = false
        var body: some View {
            Text("Hello, World!")
                .frame(maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: bouncing ? .bottom : .top)
                .animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration: 5.0).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: bouncing)
                .onAppear {
                    self.bouncing.toggle()
                }
        }
    }
