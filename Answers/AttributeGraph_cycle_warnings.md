Q: How do I debug SwiftUI AttributeGraph cycle warnings? (by Sindre Sorhus)

A: The log is generated by (from private *AttributeGraph.framework*)

```
AG::Graph::print_cycle(unsigned int) const ()
```

so you can set symbolic breakpoint for `print_cycle`

and, well, how much it could be helpful depends on your scenario, but definitely you'll get error generated stack in Xcode.

the symbol has been found with help of Terminal command

```
$ nm /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AttributeGraph.framework/AttributeGraph
```
