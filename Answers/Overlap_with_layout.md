Q: How can I manage this view when constraints aren't available to me in swiftui? (by swiftandRoll)

A: If you already have such `popUpView` and `myButton` components prepared in SwiftUI, the alignment like on screen can be done actually in two lines

```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack(alignment: .bottom) {    // << here !!
            PopUpView()
            MyButton()
                .alignmentGuide(.bottom) { $0.height / 2 } // << here !!
        }
    }
}
```
