Q: Crashlytics: What does compiler-generated means? (by C. Moulinet)

A: Compiler-generated means code injected into final binary by 
swift compiler. This might be unrolled inline-type library function, 
optimisation things, etc. The crash-log on your screenshot just 
shows *the top* call of the failed execution stack, and in majority of 
cases it is not your code line (while there is the reason) but some 
standard function call (from library or autogenerated). So you have 
to investigate not just one first line, but complete back trace 
of crashed stack.
